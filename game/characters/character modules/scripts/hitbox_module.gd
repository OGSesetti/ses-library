#	The "damage" variable is taken from parent automatically unless configured manually.
#	If "damage" doesn't exist in parent, the damage will be set to zero.

#	Not that I think about it, that first damage check might be pointless, since it might be	
#	impossible to configure the damage before the module has already loaded and the set the damage 
#	for itself...

#	Aaaah well doesn't hurt to be like that either. I think.

#	Remember to check that the damage actually gets loaded properly from 'gun' to 'bullet' to 'hitbox'
